# Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on automated lung cancer detection from CT scan images 
using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: LIDC-IDRI / Kaggle Lung Cancer Dataset
- Preprocessing includes normalization, resizing, and augmentation

## Model Architecture
- CNN / ResNet / MIL-based model
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, F1-score

## Results
- Accuracy: 92%
- AUC: 0.94

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Train or run inference

## Future Improvements
- Add explainability (Grad-CAM)
- Try transformer-based models
